Tasks:
 1. Win & Lose State
 2. Unit Tests - 1) When your player is hit, to lose life 2) When you jump on a spring to change the player's Y position 
 3. Controller support
 4. Do at least one of the following tasks (Bonus points for those who do both! (^_^) ):
   <br/>4.1. Procedurally generated levels - You can have one level as an introductory level and after that all levels will be generated. You can either try:
   <br/>4.1.1. To use dynamic generation of platforms while you play
   <br/>4.1.2. To generate in advance the whole level
   <br/>4.1.3. something else?
   <br/>4.2. Multi-player:
   <br/>4.2.1. Sync movement and animations
   <br/>4.2.2. Distinct players by showing players' names above their heads like "Player1", "Player2", etc.
   <br/>4.2.3. Make a winning condition like who gets first to the top or the first to get a key
   <br/>4.2.4. Show all players who is the winner
 5. Juice - Whatever you want, minimum 2 effects (Blood, Camera Shake etc) check Game Feel 
 6. A way to kill your enemies - By picking a powerup like in Pac-Man, by shooting projectiles at them, the choice is yours
 
 ***For the task it's recommended to use your project from practice and not the one from this repository!***
